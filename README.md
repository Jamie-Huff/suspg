This is an application designed to display metrics for resource consumption, based off of a set of sample data provided by [SPG](https://suspg.com/).

The project is created with ReactJS and TypeScript.

## Starting the project
1. Open a terminal for both the 'suspg-frontend' and 'spg_test_restful_api'
2. In each terminal run
### `npm i` 
To install require dependencies for both the front end and backend

3. After installing, run
### `npm start`
In the backend terminal.

4. Next run 
### `npm start`
In the front end terminal.

If there is a port conflict error you may have to change your default port for either of the applications. The front end will prompt you to change your port if there is a conflict, so always start the backend first.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the backend in the browser.
